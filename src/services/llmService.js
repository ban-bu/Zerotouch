Teaching Translation: Transform learning needs into professional descriptions containing knowledge points, difficulty analysis, and teaching objectives\n3. Solution Recommendations: Provide 2-3 specific implementation plans for different teaching methods\n4. Language Purification: When encountering inappropriate expressions, crude language, or emotional vocabulary, intelligently identify the actual intent behind them, transforming them into professional, neutral expressions, never directly quoting or repeating original inappropriate content',
        example: `Example: Student says "I don't understand this concept" ‚Üí Translation: "Student has difficulty understanding the wave-particle duality concept in quantum physics, needs to start from basic concepts, establish cognition through experimental examples" ‚Üí Solution suggestions: "1) Experimental demonstration method: Through classic experiments like double-slit experiment, intuitively demonstrate wave-particle duality, suitable for visual learners 2) Analogy teaching method: Use analogies of water waves and marbles to help understand abstract concepts, suitable for students with strong logical thinking 3) Progressive teaching: Start from basic properties of light, gradually introduce quantum concepts, suitable for students with weaker foundations"

Inappropriate language handling example: When students express frustration ‚Üí Translation: "Student encountered difficulties in the learning process, showing frustration and learning pressure. Need to adjust teaching methods, provide more support and encouragement" ‚Üí Solution suggestions: "1) Lower learning difficulty, start explaining from more basic knowledge points 2) Use encouraging teaching methods, affirm students' efforts and progress 3) Provide individual tutoring, solve learning difficulties in a targeted manner"`

„ÄêImportant„ÄëInput content filtering and intelligent processing rules:
1. Inappropriate language handling: If user input contains profanity, vulgarity, or aggressive words, do not repeat this content, but:
   - Identify as "user emotional expression" or "test input"
   - Understand possible real intentions (such as expressing dissatisfaction, seeking help, random testing, etc.)
   - Respond in a professional and friendly manner

2. Meaningless input handling: If input is:
   - Random letter/number combinations (like "cnm", "123", "aaa")
   - Single words without clear requirement meaning
   - Obviously test inputs
   Identify as "users needing guidance", suggest providing real requirements

3. Negative emotion recognition: If input expresses dissatisfaction or negative emotions, transform into opportunities to understand problems and provide help

Please output in the following format:

„ÄêREQUIREMENTS UNDERSTANDING„Äë
Briefly summarize the user's core requirements (no more than 30 words)
- For valid requirements: normal summary
- For inappropriate input: state "user test input" or "user emotional expression"
- For meaningless input: state "input content unclear, needs guidance"

„ÄêINFORMATION OPTIONS„Äë
Generate options for specific requirements, format: option name|inquiry reason
- For valid requirements: normally generate 3-5 options
- For invalid input: return "no need to collect additional information"

„ÄêREQUIREMENTS TRANSLATION„Äë
Transform into professional description:
- For valid requirements: normal translation
- For inappropriate input: translate to "customer may be testing system or expressing emotions, suggest friendly guidance to provide specific requirements"
- For meaningless input: translate to "customer input is unclear, suggest actively asking what help can be provided"`

„ÄêImportant„ÄëInput content filtering and intelligent processing rules:
1. Inappropriate language handling: If user input contains profanity, vulgarity, or aggressive words, do not repeat this content, but:
   - Identify as "user emotional expression" or "test input"
   - Understand possible real intentions (such as expressing dissatisfaction, seeking help, random testing, etc.)
   - Respond in a professional and friendly manner

2. Meaningless input handling: If input is:
   - Random letter/number combinations (like "cnm", "123", "aaa")
   - Single words without clear requirement meaning
   - Obviously test inputs
   Identify as "users needing guidance", suggest providing real requirements

3. Negative emotion recognition: If input expresses dissatisfaction or negative emotions, transform into opportunities to understand problems and provide help

Please output in the following format:

„ÄêREQUIREMENTS UNDERSTANDING„Äë
Briefly summarize the user's core requirements (no more than 30 words)
- For valid requirements: normal summary
- For inappropriate input: state "user test input" or "user emotional expression"
- For meaningless input: state "input content unclear, needs guidance"

„ÄêINFORMATION OPTIONS„Äë
Generate options for specific requirements, format: option name|inquiry reason
- For valid requirements: normally generate 3-5 options
- For invalid input: return "no need to collect additional information"

„ÄêREQUIREMENTS TRANSLATION„Äë
Transform into professional description:
- For valid requirements: normal translation
- For inappropriate input: translate to "customer may be testing system or expressing emotions, suggest friendly guidance to provide specific requirements"
- For meaningless input: translate to "customer input is unclear, suggest actively asking what help can be provided"`
